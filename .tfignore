# This .tfignore file was automatically created by Microsoft(R) Visual Studio.
#
# Local items matching filespecs in this file will not be added to version
# control. This file can be checked in to share exclusions with others.
#
# Wildcard characters are * and ?. Patterns are matched recursively unless the
# pattern is prefixed by the \ character.
#
# You can prepend a path to a pattern to make it more specific. If you do,
# wildcard characters are not permitted in the path portion.
#
# The # character at the beginning of a line indicates a comment.
#
# The ! prefix negates a pattern. This can be used to re-include an item after
# it was excluded by a .tfignore file higher in the tree, or by the Team
# Project Collection's global exclusions list.
#
# The / character is interpreted as a \ character on Windows platforms.
#
# Examples:
#
#  # Excludes all files ending in .txt in Alpha\Beta and all its subfolders.
#  Alpha\Beta\*.txt
#
#  # Excludes all files ending in .cpp in this folder only.
#  \*.cpp
#
#  # Excludes all files ending in .cpp in this folder and all subfolders.
#  *.cpp
#
#  # If "Contoso" is a folder, then Contoso and all its children are excluded.
#  # If it is a file, then only the "Contoso" in this folder is excluded.
#  \Contoso
#
#  # If Help.exe is excluded by a higher .tfignore file or by the Team Project
#  # Collection global exclusions list, then this pattern re-includes it in
#  # this folder only.
#  !\Help.exe
